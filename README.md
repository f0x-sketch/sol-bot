# Solana AI Trading Bot

This project aims to develop a simple AI-driven trading bot for the Solana blockchain. The bot will utilize AI models via OpenRouter for decision-making based on real-time blockchain data fetched via WebSocket.

**Note:** This is a basic framework and requires significant further development for actual trading.

## Features (Planned)

- Connect to Solana WebSocket for real-time data.
- Integrate with OpenRouter for AI model access.
- Basic AI-driven trading decision logic.
- Placeholder for trade execution on Solana.
- Simple UI concept.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/f0x-sketch/sol-bot.git
    cd sol-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
    ```env
    SOLANA_RPC_URL="YOUR_SOLANA_RPC_URL"
    SOLANA_WS_URL="YOUR_SOLANA_WEBSOCKET_URL"
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
    # PROGRAM_ID="YOUR_PROGRAM_ID" # Optional: if monitoring a specific program
    ```
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual RPC, WebSocket URLs, and OpenRouter API Key.

## Running the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the bot, connect to the WebSocket, and print output to the console. The UI is currently a placeholder.

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: The main script containing the bot's core logic.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
-   `README.md`: Project description and setup instructions.

## Further Development

-   Implement robust error handling and reconnection logic.
-   Develop sophisticated AI trading strategies.
-   Integrate with a Solana wallet for secure key management and transaction signing.
-   Build a functional user interface.
-   Add comprehensive testing.
-   Explore specific Solana program interactions.
